# Machine_Learning Projects

Doing mini projects to help learn to do Linear and Logistic regression as well Naive Bayes and Clustering 

 1. Notebooks 
The notebooks below contain the data analysis and ML code used for this project. Due to the intensive computing requirements for running the neural networks, the ML models were broken down into separate notebooks so they could be run in parallel in a high performance cloud computing environment. 
    - [Linear Regression] (https://github.com/sethorus30/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Mini_Project_Linear_Regression%20(3).ipynb)
   Report containing data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning explanation for the project
    - [Logistic Regression] (https://github.com/sethorus30/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Mini_Project_Logistic_Regression.ipynb)
    
    - [Naive Bayes] (https://github.com/sethorus30/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Mini_Project_Naive_Bayes%20(1).ipynb)
     learning fundamental technique in Bayesian inference, called Naive Bayes
    
    - [Clustering] (https://github.com/sethorus30/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Mini_project_Clustering_2%20(3)%20(1).ipynb)
